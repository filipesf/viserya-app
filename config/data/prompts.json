      "generalView": "For this general view scene, use a mid-range angle/medium-wide shot that provides a balanced perspective, capturing the overall environment and characters without focusing too much on any specific element. This shot should be at eye level to maintain a natural and relatable viewpoint. Ensure the scene is well-lit with even, neutral lighting to avoid casting strong shadows, creating a clear and consistent view of the setting. The background should include enough detail to establish the context and location, but it should not dominate the frame. Elements like furniture, landscape features, or general scenery should be present to create a sense of place, while still keeping the primary focus on the overall scene rather than individual components.",
      "battleEncounter": "For this battle encounter scene, use a low angle/wide shot from a lower vantage point, looking up to make the characters appear more imposing and dynamic, capturing the scale and intensity of the battle. Central characters in combat should be prominent, with dynamic poses, and include elements of the battlefield like terrain, other fighters, and environmental hazards. High contrast lighting with dramatic shadows and highlights should emphasise action and movement, with directional lighting creating a sense of urgency. The background should be detailed to show the chaotic environment, with motion blur on peripheral elements to suggest movement.",
      "characterPortrait": "For this character portrait, use a close-up shot focusing on the character from the chest up, with the face centred and well-lit, capturing the character's expression and key features, using a slight upward angle to convey importance and heroism. Soft, even lighting should highlight facial features and textures, with a slight rim light to add depth. The background should be blurred or softly focused to ensure the character stands out, possibly including faint hints of the character's environment or symbolic elements.",
      "monsterPortrait": "For this monster portrait, use a full-body shot capturing the entire figure of the monster from head to toe, with the monster centred and well-lit. Position the camera at a slight downward angle to convey a sense of grandeur and dominance. Ensure the lighting is soft and even, highlighting the textures and details of the monster's body, with a slight rim light to add depth. The background should be softly focused or blurred, ensuring the monster stands out clearly, and it may include faint hints of the monster's environment or symbolic elements to add context.",
      "charactersAreIndoors": "For this scene where the characters are indoors, use a medium shot capturing characters from the waist up to show interactions and surroundings, with the angle at or slightly above eye level to create an intimate and relatable perspective. Position characters to utilise the indoor space effectively, ensuring faces and body language are clear. Warm, indoor lighting with shadows should add depth and texture, using practical light sources like candles, lanterns, or windows to create a cosy atmosphere. The background should include enough detail to establish the indoor setting without distracting from the characters, with elements like furniture, tapestries, or shelves enhancing the scene's context.",
      "cityOverview": "For this city overview scene, use a high angle/wide shot from a bird's-eye view or high vantage point to capture the city's expanse and layout, highlighting architecture, streets, and key landmarks. Ensure the city's iconic structures are prominent, conveying its scale and grandeur. Natural lighting should add dramatic shadows and highlights, enhancing the city's depth and detail.",
      "overviewFromWithinTheCity": "For this overview from within the city, use an eye-level/wide shot to create an immersive, street-level view, capturing the hustle and bustle, architecture, and daily life within the location. Include a mix of buildings, streets, and people to show vibrant activity, with key landmarks or central squares prominent to provide a sense of place. Natural lighting with soft shadows, ideally during the golden hour, should create warmth and depth.

Ensure the main characters involved in the interaction have clear faces and expressions, with surrounding elements like tables, chairs, and decor hinting at the setting. Use warm and inviting lighting to reflect the nature of the encounter, with soft shadows to maintain a friendly atmosphere. The background should be partially blurred to focus on the characters but detailed enough to establish the setting.",
      "withMultipleCharacters": "For this scene with multiple characters, a medium wide shot should capture the group and some surrounding environment, at eye level to maintain a natural perspective. Arrange characters in a semi-circle or similar composition to ensure all are visible, with the environment supporting the scene's context without overpowering the characters. Balanced lighting should ensure all characters are well-lit, with additional lighting to highlight key characters or actions.
