      <h2 id="why-voryn-was-created">Why Voryn was created</h2>

      <p>
        Voryn was designed to enable players to engage in asynchronous gameplay
        over text, utilizing AI as their Dungeon Master. While it may not fully
        replicate the in-person experience of playing Dungeons &amp; Dragons, it
        offers a unique and enjoyable alternative.
      </p>

      <p>
        Harnessing the combined power of Discord, Avrae, D&amp;D Beyond, and
        ChatGPT, Voryn allows multiple players to interact with the AI
        simultaneously.
      </p>

      <p>
        Currently, Voryn creates immersive stories primarily set in the
        homebrewed D&amp;D campaign world of Viserya. However, exciting
        developments are on the horizon, with plans to allow customization for
        your own scenarios.
      </p>

      <p>
        Below, you‚Äôll find a comprehensive guide to maximize your experience
        with Voryn.

        Part 1: Getting started with Voryn
      </h2>

      <p>
        Before venturing into the Realm of Viserya, you must initiate the
        session with <strong>Voryn</strong>. To do this, you‚Äôll use the{' '}
        <strong>slash commands</strong> provided by the bot. Think of these
        commands as the magical keys that unlock the gateway to your adventure.
      </p>

      <h3 id="step-1-start-your-session">Step 1: Start Your Session</h3>

      <p>
        To begin a new session, type the following command in the channel or
        thread where you wish to play:
      </p>

      <pre>
        <code>/startsession</code>
      </pre>

      <ul>
        <li>
          This begins a new D&amp;D session with <strong>Voryn</strong> as your
          guide.
        </li>
        <li>
          Each thread can only host one active session at a time, so make sure
          you‚Äôre in the right place!
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        By default, Voryn initiates new sessions in English. However, it also
        has the capability to converse with you in Brazilian Portuguese,
        offering a more inclusive experience. At any point during your session
        you can ask Voryn to change the language. Those are just shortcuts to
        set it up.
      </p>

      <pre>
        <code>/startsession language:Portugu√™s</code>
      </pre>

      <h4>
        <em>So it begins...</em>
      </h4>

      <p>
        Once the session begins, Voryn will create a new thread, add the user
        who triggered the command to it, and send a welcome message with
        instructions.
      </p>

      <h3 id="step-2-check-active-sessions">Step 2: Check Active Sessions</h3>

      <p>
        If you‚Äôre unsure whether there‚Äôs already an active session running,{' '}
        <strong>Voryn</strong> will let you know if there‚Äôs an ongoing session
        in the current thread. Simply type:
      </p>

      <pre>
        <code>/checksessions</code>
      </pre>

      <h3 id="step-3-end-the-session">Step 3: End the Session</h3>

      <p>
        Once you are done with your adventure, end the current session with.
        You‚Äôll need to do this before starting a new session in the same channel
        or thread.
      </p>

      <pre>
        <code>/endsession</code>
      </pre>

      <p>
        Once the session ends, Voryn will lock the thread, and send a summary of
        the outcomes, loot, and rewards. Once the session ends, you will not be
        able to interact with Voryn in the same conversation context and a new
        session will be required.
